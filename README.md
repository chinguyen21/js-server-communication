## AJAX, Promises, and Fetch (Communicating with APIs)

- What is AJAX? Async JavaScript and XML
- What is blocking (sync) vs non-blocking code (async)?

### How do we handle async code?

- For example, event listeners
- So what would server communication look like since it's async?

### Callback Hell

- Nested callbacks within nested callbacks
- Triangle shape
- Really hard to read and manage

### Welcome Fetch

- Built in web api
- Get JSON data
- Returns a promise object
- Practice with: https://animal-farm-api.herokuapp.com/animals

### Promises and what are they

- [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
- Practice with: http://localhost:300/hello/1
- pending
- fulfilled (resolved/rejected)
- How to unwrap a promise using `.then`
- At Flatiron, we will work with promises via Fetch rather than creating our own Promises

### Promise chaining

- `.then().then()`
- Easier to read, easier to manage

#### Reminder:

- First FSPs this Friday
- Even if you're not in the first group, start it asap, talk to the coaches
